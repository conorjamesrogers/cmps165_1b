<!--
1. A Title for the Project
2. Purpose or objective of the project (in less than 4 or 5 sentences)
3. Provide Data Sources with appropriate agency names and clickable web links
At this time, I am expecting 1-3 data sources. This can be enriched further later.
4. Provide Relevant Visualization sources with appropriate titles, agencies, time, and clickable
web links
The closest past project(s) (if any) must be cited under “Visualization Sources”. In addition, I am expecting 1-3
visualization links. This can also be enriched further later.
5. (optional) Any additional references references to articles or additional information on the
project may be added as a separate link in a compact one page (and no more!)
Host the above information on the web using an html/css file and supported via github. In this
step, although you can attempt to have compact clutter-free presentation layout, the next step will
require elegant presentation layout. In this step, you need to focus only on the contents.
A. You must include your full name as it appears on the class roster; (no nick name please!).3
B. You must include an email address that can be used by your classmates to form groups.
C. A weblink stating Gitbub Link which is clickable and takes the user to the github link where
your html and css files are located.

        <a>Project Title</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Approximate Orbital Display</li>
        </ul>
        <a>Purpose or Objective</a>
        <ul>
            <li>To visualize an approximation of satellites orbiting the earth. 
                A 3D display of earth that will be zoomable and show a position of satellites orbiting the planet. 
                The Data needed is retreivable online-- Using the US airforce's "Space-Track.org" we can retrieve
                TLE (Two Line Element) of satellite bodies and cross reference the satellite number with other data.
                A JS library (satellite.js) will decipher and do all the heavy lifting-- allowing us to impliment the front end. 
                After getting the inclination ect. we can display the satellites “orbit” 
                and display some simple movement in real time. The Airforce has A L O T of TLEs, therefore I will probably only include some of the latest Satellites launched.</li>

        <a>Data Sources</a>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database#.WwNQeHXwak0">UCSUSA</a>
            provides a .csv full of satellite information</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.space-track.org/auth/login">Space-Track</a>
            A US Airforce database of TLE's of all non-classified satellites</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.heavens-above.com/main.aspx">Heavens Above Database</a>
            Used in last years Satellite Flares project. Essencialy uses Space-Track and TLEs-- can be used to double check outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <a>Relevant Visualization Sources</a>
        <li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/068ef3e4106e155467a3">d3.orbit example</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/6c149c08fc9cde682635">Satellite Ground Paths</a>
            My project would be similar, but in a 3D plane with more variation of satellites. perhaps an adjustable timer with mouseover tool tips providing information on each object. </li>

            Satellite Flares</a> A past project showing placements of flares in the night sky. My project would be very different: 
            showing a 3D globe with moving sattelites-- it would also not limit itself to just FLARE satellties. </li>
